    <h1> KEYBOARD</h1>
</body><P>A computer keyboard is a peripheral input device modeled after the typewriter <br>keyboard[1] [2]which uses an arrangement of buttons or keys to act as mechanical levers or electronic switches. Replacing early punched cards and paper tape technology, interaction via teleprinter-style keyboards have been the
     main input method for computers since the 1970s, supplemented by <br>the computer mouse since the 1980s.</P>
