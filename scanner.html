    <h1> SCANNER</h1>
</body><P>A scanner is a device that captures images from photographic prints, posters,<br>
     magazine pages and similar sources for computer editing and display. <br>
    Scanners work by converting the image on the document into digital <br>
     information that can be stored on a computer through optical character recognition (OCR).</P>
